I've written this in Ubuntu and I am using tools already available to me in this environment. so some things might not work in other distros.

I do not guarantee anything but I come close to.

Also if you happen to have a window manager other than compiz just use the "log on" part of it. with it logs you off when the thin window manager closes.

* Menu with: 'quit, log off, turn off, troubleshoot, install textures, install mods, Re-Fetching of the launcher, Restart of launcher/game, Force game files to re-download, and a fix to sticky keys'
* aided texture pack installation, will only add one and link from the other modpacks to lower space used
* aided mod installation for per modpack to avoid conflicts with other modpacks
* Versions shown in main menu for easy tracking

Reasoning of troubelshoot items
-----
* For the Re-fetching of the launcher is an old problem I used to have where it will hang even before it could download anything, deleting it and re-downloading it seemed to work.
* Restart of launcher: in oldish systems minecraft likes to freeze so this is a quick way to fix that. (granted if you can release the mouse of MineCraft)
* Force game files re-download: I run a server and sometimes the clients will give me a "mod missing or outdated" and this fixes it. it forces everything to re-download (not touching saves, statistics, last-login)
* Fix Sticky keys: this downloads an updated version of lwjgl and installs it to the game files, and seems to fix the sticky key situation.
